This project is a machine learning-based approach to predict the presence of heart disease using patient health data. It leverages several classification algorithms to evaluate and compare model performance, helping identify risk factors and provide early diagnostic support.

📁 Project Structure
HeartDepi.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing all preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation code.

Dataset: The dataset used is the Heart Disease UCI dataset or a similar structured dataset with common features used in heart disease prediction.

📊 Features Used
Typical features in the dataset include:

Age

Sex

Chest pain type (cp)

Resting blood pressure (trestbps)

Serum cholesterol (chol)

Fasting blood sugar (fbs)

Resting electrocardiographic results (restecg)

Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)

Exercise-induced angina (exang)

ST depression induced by exercise (oldpeak)

Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (slope)

Number of major vessels (ca)

Thalassemia (thal)

🚀 Models Implemented
Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

Naive Bayes

📈 Evaluation Metrics
Models are evaluated using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

ROC Curve and AUC Score

📌 How to Run This Project
Ensure Python is installed on your system (preferably version 3.7+).

Install Jupyter Notebook or use a cloud environment like Google Colab.

Open the HeartDepi.ipynb notebook.

Run the cells sequentially from top to bottom:

Load and explore the dataset.

Preprocess and clean the data.

Train and evaluate different machine learning models.

Review the model performance metrics and plots at the end to analyze results.

🧠 Goal
The goal is to identify the most effective machine learning model for accurately predicting heart disease risk based on patient data.

✅ Results
The notebook compares performance across models and identifies which algorithm achieves the best accuracy and generalization on test data.
